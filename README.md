## Introduction

Mia's Place is a social hub for artists and art lovers.

The aim is to help local, young -or young-in-spirit- artists get more exposure for their work, help small businesses while entertaining all, who's interested or just wants to have a drink in a cozy and quirky locale.
The website was created as a sort of adverisement for the place, providing basic information, gallery and a channel to get in touch through.

I created this website for my first project as I've got most of my work experience in hospitality and back then I had this idea of creating a space where creators can express their thoughts, feelings and personality through art.
Where spectators can admire, relate and connect with the person on the other side of the piece all the while having fun and enjoying themselves. A culture-pub - if you will.

In the following sections I will showcase how the website was built. Including tools, ideas and help aquired.

### Colours

I used only two colours when building the site as to achieve the look of a minimalistic, polished undertone keeping in mind the accessibility for people with sight problems.

The colours are:

1. Mercury Color ( Hex: #ebebeb) - as a background color
2. Black Kite ( Hex: #301919) - for several design elements, ex. header, box-shadow.

### Typography

When it came to choosing fonts for the site, I found it important to -again- consider individuals that are sight-impaired. 
Decided on using:

1. Lato - for paragraphs.
2. Poppins - for headings.

Both of which were used by applying the *sans-serif style* to further assure visibility.

### Images

Every image was carefully considered and placed on each page with the intention to grab the attention of the visitor as well as to give a sort of *feel* of the physical place before visiting or provide a sense of familiarity to those who are returning.
All images were sourced from two places: Pexels.com and the Facebook page of my favourite bar back home in Romania.

## Features

### Existing features

- The Header : This fully responsive feature will allow users to navigate the website without ever having to revert back to the preiious page by using the 'back' button.

![Large screen header](<https://github.com/tmea-farkas/mias_place/blob/main/assets/images/header.png>)

- The landing page:
The landing page is my favourite. It's simple but informative. The visitor will know the base ethos and will feel inticed to know more.
![Home page](<https://github.com/tmea-farkas/mias_place/blob/main/assets/images/home-page.png>)

- The footer:
The footer is available on every page and provides links to all relevant social media for the user to help keep in contact and informed of all events.

-The Events page:
This page is as a gallery for now, but intended to have all necessary information regarding events. **Note the alternative text feature for accessibility.**

-The Enquire page:
The Enquire page is equipped with a clear and simple form where the user, if interested, is able to contact us with any question or query. **All areas validated, so the user won't be able to submit an empty or incorrectly filled form**

-The Thank you page
To ensure visitor satisfaction and instant feedback, I've added a thank you page that will pop-up once the form is submitted. It also has a button that will take the user back the the Home page.
