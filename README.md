## Introduction

Mia's Place is a social hub for artists and art lovers.

The aim is to help local, young -or young-in-spirit- artists get more exposure for their work, help small businesses while entertaining all, who's interested or just wants to have a drink in a cozy and quirky locale.
The website was created as a sort of adverisement for the place, providing basic information, gallery and a channel to get in touch through.

I created this website for my first project as I've got most of my work experience in hospitality and back then I had this idea of creating a space where creators can express their thoughts, feelings and personality through art.
Where spectators can admire, relate and connect with the person on the other side of the piece all the while having fun and enjoying themselves. A culture-pub - if you will.

In the following sections I will showcase how the website was built. Including tools, ideas and help aquired.

## User Experience

## Design 

### Colours

I used only two colours when building the site as to achieve the look of a minimalistic, polished undertone keeping in mind the accessibility for people with sight problems.

The colours are:

1. Mercury Color ( Hex: #ebebeb) - as a background color
2. Black Kite ( Hex: #301919) - for several design elements, ex. header, box-shadow.

### Typography

When it came to choosing fonts for the site, I found it important to -again- consider individuals that are sight-impaired. 
Decided on using:

1. Lato - for paragraphs.
2. Poppins - for headings.

Both of which were used by applying the *sans-serif style* to further assure visibility.

### Images 

Every image was carefully considered and placed on each page with the intention to grab the attention of the visitor as well as to give a sort of *feel* of the physical place before visiting or provide a sense of familiarity to those who are returning.
All images were sourced from two places: Pexels.com and the Facebook page of my favourite bar back home in Romania.
