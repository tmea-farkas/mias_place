## Introduction

Mia's Place is a social hub for artists and art lovers.

The aim is to help local, young -or young-in-spirit - artists get more exposure for their work, help small businesses while entertaining all that are interested or just want to have a drink in a cozy and quirky locale.
The website was created as a sort of adverisement for the place, providing basic information, gallery and a channel to get in touch through.

I created this website for my first project as I've got most of my work experience in hospitality and back then I had this idea of creating a space where creators can express their thoughts, feelings and personality through art.
Where spectators can admire, relate and connect with the person on the other side of the piece all the while having fun and enjoying themselves. A culture-pub - if you will.

In the following sections I will showcase how the website was built. Including tools, ideas and help acquired.

## User Experience

### User stories

- As a first time user I want
  - to understand the purpose of the project from the first time I get to the landing page
  - to be able to easily navigate through the content
  - to progress through the pages easily without feeling overwhelmed or confused by the material
  - to have only the neccessary information available without having to comb through to find what I need
- As a returning user I want
  - to be able to find new information easily
  - to be able to contact the creator for further information or to provide feedback
  
Considering the user stories I approached the project the following way:

The objective was to create a website that is easy to navigate, all necessary information and tools provided for the user to be able to research and get in contact with the business.

Initially, I wanted to add other features, like further information about the artworks and artists that we worked with in the past, but I realised that for the user that information is easily accessible either in person or via email, so users that are not interested wouldn't have to scroll through information that they don't need to get to the parts they do.

When organising the content, I aimed for simplicity and logic. Having an introduction and basic information on the first page meant that the user (new or returning) will be able to see who we are and what could be of interest for them.

The navigation of the website is easy and accessible. There are multiple ways to navigate the pages and is structurally logical.

Lastly, on the surface the user will experience a website that is informative, easily navigated and visually pleasing. For users that have visual impairments there are alternative ways to realise what the website is about, like alternative text underneath images and well a contrasting colour-scheme.

## Design

### Colours

I used only two colours when building the site as to achieve the look of a minimalistic, polished undertone keeping in mind the accessibility for people with sight problems.

The colours are:

1. Mercury Color (Hex: #ebebeb) - as a background color
2. Black Kite (Hex: #301919) - for several design elements, ex. header, box-shadow.

### Typography

When it came to choosing fonts for the site, I found it important to consider individuals that are sight-impaired.
Decided on using:

1. Lato - for paragraphs.
2. Poppins - for headings.

Both of which were used by applying the *sans-serif style* to further assure visibility.

### Images

Every image was carefully considered and placed on each page with the intention to grab the attention of the visitor as well as to give a sort of *feel* of the physical place before visiting or provide a sense of familiarity to those who are returning.

## Features

### Existing features

#### The Header

This fully responsive feature will allow users to navigate the website without ever having to revert back to the previous page by using the 'back' button.

#### The landing page

The landing page is my favourite. It's simple but informative.
The visitor will know the base ethos and will feel enticed to know more.

#### The footer

The footer is visible on every page and provides links to all relevant social media for the user to help keep in contact and informed of all events.

#### The Events page

This page is as a gallery for now, but intended to have all necessary information regarding events. **Note the alternative text feature for accessibility.**

#### The Enquire page

The Enquire page is equipped with a clear and simple form where the user, if interested, is able to contact us with any question or query. **All areas validated, so the user won't be able to submit an empty or incorrectly filled form**

#### The Thank you page

To ensure visitor satisfaction and instant feedback, I've added a thank you page that will pop-up once the form is submitted. It also has a button that will take the user back the the Home page.
